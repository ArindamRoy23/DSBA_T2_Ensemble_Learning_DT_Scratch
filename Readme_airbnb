The data set used in this project showcases the
Airbnb listings and their features in New York City
between the years 2011 and 2019. It includes a
comprehensive collection of information pertaining
to hosts, geographical locations, room features, and
pricing. The primary objective of this task is to
employ ensemble learning techniques to predict the
houses prices. In this report, we will first perform descriptive analysis on the data set followed by a preparation of our data-frame to then after explore the use
of various ensemble learning methods and their application in solving this regression problem.
